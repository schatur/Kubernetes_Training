Creating a Cluster with Minikube
Minikube Options
A cluster can be created with just minikube start but we want to customise the configuration a bit. So let's have a look at the possible options.

minikube start -h
Starting a Cluster
For our first cluster we want to use Kubernetes version v1.20.0 and give it 2 cpus with 4GB memory.

minikube start --cpus 2 --memory 4096 --kubernetes-version v1.20.0
This is the latest Kubernetes version available at the moment link

Status Check
Once our cluster is created we want to check on its status.

minikube status
Minikube Addons
Lets see what Add-Ons are available.

minikube addons list
Let's enable few more addons using:

minikube addons enable ingress
minikube addons enable registry
minikube addons enable metrics-server
minikube addons enable dashboard
Dashboard
We can then access the Dashboard using:

minikube dashboard
Services
We can also see what services are available in the cluster using:

minikube service list
Minikube logs
If we want to see the Minikube logs we can also do that using

minikube logs
Minikube Docker Daemon
To point the terminal to use the docker daemon inside minikube use this:

eval $(minikube docker-env)
This will show uscontainers inside the minikube:

docker ps
