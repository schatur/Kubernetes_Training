Task1 - Installing the Pre-requisites
In this task we will install the pre-requisite tools for completing our project.

Tools
The tools we will install are:

Tool	Description
kubectl	The Kubernetes CLI.
docker	The container runtime used by minikube.
Minikube	A single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a contianer.
Helm	The Kubernetes package manager.
kubectx and kubens	Helper scripts for changing Kubernetes contexts and namespaces.
kubetail	Helper script to easily tail logs from Pods.
Notes

kubectx, kubens and kubetail only work on Mac or Linux systems.
Kubectl Installation
The Kubernetes Command-Line tool that allows to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. The instructions for installing kubectl can be found here.

There are various ways to install kubectl but we will focus on how to do it using curl. Scroll down the page until you reach the section Install kubectl binary via curl. We will install the latest version of kubectl, so use the following commands.

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
Now, let's change the file permission for kubectl

chmod +x ./kubectl
Let's move it to the /usr/local/bin directory

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
Docker Installation
Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS. Copu and Paste these commands one by one in the terminal. The official installation documentation page for docker can be found here.

sudo apt-get update
Then this cmd:

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
Press Y and then Enter.

Then we have to add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Use the following command to set up the stable repository:

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
Press Y and then Enter.

And install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd `

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Allowing Permission to the sock:
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
Minikube Installation
Installing minikube using binary download option.

The releases for minikube can be found here.

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
Snap Installation
Snap is a software deployment and package management system developed by Canonical.

sudo apt install snap
Helm Installation
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. `

sudo snap install helm --classic
Kubectx and Kubens Installation
Helper scripts for changing Kubernetes contexts and namespaces. The github repo for kubectx and kubens can be found here. First Let's get Kubectx and Kubens from github using:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetb/kubectx/master/kubectx
And then

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetb/kubectx/master/kubens
Now, let's change the file permission for kubectx and kubens

sudo chmod +x kubectx kubens
Let's move it to the /usr/local/bin directory

sudo mv kubectx kubens /usr/local/bin
Kubetail Installation
A helper script for easily tail logs from pods.

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johanhaleby/kubetail/master/kubetail
Now, let's change the file permission for kubetail

sudo chmod +x kubetail
Let's move it to the /usr/local/bin directory

sudo mv kubetail /usr/local/bin
